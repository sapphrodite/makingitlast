# Journalism 101: Performing Quality Research

## Part 1: Integrity and Quality
Underpinning every effective advertisement, academic article, or journalistic piece is a body of research. Your research, usually composed of interviews, archival work, and prior research by others, builds the required integrity of your work. Before you begin, there are a few key concepts to grasp:
- **Curiosity and Criticality**: If you want to understand a topic, you need to ask questions and find answers. Mark down moments that give you pause, pay attention to and follow your critical instinct. This is where all good research starts.
- **Attention to Detail**: While it is important to keep track of the big picture, that does not mean you can sacrifice precision and accuracy. Laziness in detail leads to laziness in total. These details are the foundation of your research and the resulting work.
- **Concise Communication**: Sloppy writing, poor grammar, and overly-brief or (most dangerously) overly-long pieces will leave a bad impression and prevent you from reaching your audience. Take time to proofread and have others look over your work.
- **Interdisciplinary Networking**: You don't have to be everything, you just have to be *something*. It’s important to recognize gaps in your own ability or knowledge and bridge them with the perspectives of other people. Don’t let a narrow focus lead to narrow ideas.
- **Ethics**: Conducting research means you must maintain integrity and dignity for both prior research and the subjects of your work. Proper citations, respecting the needs of sources (such as anonymity), and avoiding harmful or oppressive ways of thinking and writing are all necessary to not perpetuate existing harms in the world.

## Part 2: The Journalistic Process
With those concepts in mind, here is an outline of the journalistic process. Note that not every piece will involve every step on this list, but it's best to thorough and search as broad a variety of sources as possible.

**1: Developing Questions:** Start by crafting a set of initial questions based on your existing knowledge. Remember — It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about the topic, you will learn along the way.

**2: Literature Review:** Start reading academic papers. If you're lucky, you may find a paper dedicated to reviewing existing literature, which serves as a fantastic resource for discovering the breadth of the subject matter. Most papers include a section for literature review that reference other articles on similar topic, which is more useful for your depth of knowledge.

**3: Refining Your Understanding:** While reading papers, continually refine and expand your list of questions. Insights from literature will help you identify areas requiring further investigation. It helps to ask colleagues for their insight — sharing what you've learned is a great way to solidify and consolidate your understanding, while also providing alternative viewpoints to broaden your perspective. Repeat from step 2 until you feel confident in your progress.

**4: Identifying Experts:** Locate experts in the field who possess extensive knowledge. Explore their publications, affiliations, and contributions to the subject. Chances are, you'll have found some names from your research already! Make sure you have a solid familiarity with the topic before reaching out, as it helps make efficient use of experts' insights and time

**5: Contacting Experts:** Initiate contact, expressing interest in their work and seeking insights and answers to your questions. Remember that not everyone will reply to your messages, but that's okay! Don't be afraid to follow up every once in a while, perhaps up to 3 messages at 2 week intervals. Make a list of people you try to contact, as this information can be useful. During discussions, encourage experts to share freely. Allow them to guide the conversation and introduce points you hadn't considered.

**6: Social Engagement:** Attending relevant conferences, seminars, and webinars will help build your network of experts and colleagues. Collaborative learning enhances your understanding through group discussions and shared insights. If applicable, also explore online forums, social media groups, and discussion boards related to the subject. Participate actively, ask questions, and learn from diverse perspectives.

**7: Draw Conclusions**: Repeat this process as you gather insights from expert interactions and social engagement. This cycle refines your questions, provides deeper insights, and highlights nuances. Once you have enough information, begin to draw meaningful conclusions as you work on your final writing piece.

## Software 

The two programs that we use at the Garden for producing content are: 
- **Obsidian**, as a markdown text editor.
- **Github**, as a version control software. 

We work exclusively using markdown files, the same format that Discord uses for formatting, which means 

### Obsidian
Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files. It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way. 

You can [download obsidian here](https://obsidian.md/download), and if you need help, plant a message in #general or check out the [Obsidian Help Page](https://help.obsidian.md/Home).

### Github Desktop

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. GitHub Desktop is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub, a cloud-based platform that helps implement Git, using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. We use GitHub Desktop to help people contribute to this project even if they're not familiar with using command line interfaces!

!-- Important Distinction: Git is the version control system and GitHub is a cloud platform that uses Git. They are not interchangeable. --!

You can [download Github Desktop here](https://desktop.github.com/) and read up on [getting started with Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

## Contributing to The Garden

To get on board with our workflow and start contributing, just follow these steps once you have downloaded and installed both Obsidian and Git/GitHub Desktop:

1. **Send your GitHub username to @sapphrodite** and ask them to add you as a contributor to the repository. Once you are approved, you should receive an email from GitHub asking you to accept the invite.
2. If you have used Git or GitHub Desktop before, amazing! Otherwise, check the **GitHub Desktop Workflow section** to learn how to use Git and GitHub Desktop before heading on to the next steps. 
3. To clone our repository, go to **GitHub Desktop** and go to **File > Clone repository (Ctrl+Shift+O)**. Under the URL tab, type in `sapphrodite/makingitlast` for the **Repository URL**, and the desired folder on your computer for the **Local Path**. Hit Clone. Git will now automatically copy all the files you need onto your computer.
4. In Obsidian, go to **File > Open vault...** and click on **Open folder as vault**. Now navigate to the folder that you inputted in **Local Path** and hit Select Folder. Your files are now ready for you to edit in Obsidian!
5. Refer to Step 3 onwards in the **GitHub Desktop Workflow section** to use GitHub Desktop to save your files and collaborate with our team. We will be here to guide you through the process if you need any help!
